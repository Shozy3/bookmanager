## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**CMake can't find Qt6:**
```bash
# Set Qt6_DIR environment variable
export Qt6_DIR=/path/to/Qt/6.x.x/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt6  # Linux/macOS
set Qt6_DIR=C:\Qt\6.x.x\msvc2019_64\lib\cmake\Qt6      # Windows
```

**SQLite not found:**
```bash
# Install SQLite development libraries
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev        # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install sqlite3                    # macOS
# Windows: Usually included with Qt
```

### Runtime Errors

**Database error on startup:**
- Check write permissions in current directory
- Try deleting `prms_library.db` and restarting
- Check SQLite installation

**UI looks weird:**
- Try toggling theme (Ctrl+T)
- Check Qt version (needs Qt 6.x)
- Verify display DPI settings
